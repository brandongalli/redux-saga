# React Playbook
A monorepo with many starter projects for various JavaScript libraries for testing and learning purposes. Think of it
 like codesandbox. 
 
I'm routinely adding new packages to repo as I encounter new challenges at work and need a fast easy setup to try out
 concepts before I deal with more complex scenarios. It helps me master the fundamentals. 
 
 If you have any suggestions for packages, either create a pull request or mention it as an issue. Feel free to ping
  me too.
